## Overview

`utMOST` contract will be an ERC20 implementation for the auxiliary chain. We will be inheriting ERC20 functionalities from the ERC20 standards like `TOKEN_SYMBOL`, `TOKEN_NAME`, `TOKEN_DECIMALS`, `TOKENS_MAX`, `mint`, `burn`, `transfer`, `transferFrom`, `approve`.

`utMOST` contract will provide `ConsensusCogateway` the permission for increasing and decreasing the supply of the `utMOST` tokens in the network. It will function as the base token to pay for gas consumption on the auxiliary chain.

`utMOST` contract will handle the wrapping i.e, conversion of base token to the ERC20 most token and unwrapping i.e, conversion of ERC20 most token to the base token.

## Goals

The goal of the `utMOST` contract are:

- To have a base token on the auxiliary chain that will used to pay for gas consumption.

- To have an ERC20 based token which will have features

  - Token symbol(`TOKEN_SYMBOL`): `utMOST`
  - Token name(`TOKEN_NAME`): `Utility Token Most`
  - Token decimals(`TOKEN_DECIMALS`): `18`
  - Token cap(`TOKENS_MAX`): `<TBD>`
  - mint
  - burn
  - transfer
  - transferFrom
  - approve

- Only the `ConsensusCogateway` address will have the permission to increase and decrease the base token supply in the network.

- To be able to handle the conversion of ERC20 most token to the base token and the conversion of base token to the ERC20 most token.
