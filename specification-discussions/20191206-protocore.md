## Dual description between checkpoints and links

The objective of `Protocore` is to finalise a unique history of proposed blocks.

First we coarse-grain the history into a history of checkpoint blocks,
where for the consensus we only allow votes on blocks at
a block number which is an integer multiple of a `constant epochLength`.

However, if we implement a consensus logic with blocks or checkpoint blocks as fundamental objects, then the code will become complex.
We can delegate responsibility of ancestry checks to the layer-1 code to verify an unbroken chain of headers.

We can further construct a dual picture of `Link`s.

We do this in two steps. We define a `VoteMessage` as the known object
```
<H(T(s)), s, t, h_s, h_t>
```
which is hashed to produce a `VoteMessageHash`; and a vote message where `h_t - h_s = epochLength`, can be proposed as a `Metablock` in `Core`.

Define now a `Link` as the object
```
struct Link {
    bytes32 parentVoteMessageHash;
    bytes32 targetBlockHash;
    uint256 targetBlockHeight;
    bytes32 sourceTransitionHash;
    uint256 forwardVoteCount;
    uint256 rearVoteCount;
    FinalisationStatus targetFinalisation;
}
```

## Finalisation status of target checkpoints

### Proposed function signatures and summary

`Protocore` knows about `Link`s and `Validator`s who can vote on these links. Links become supermajority links under certain conditions specified later.


```js
contract Protocore is MasterCopyUpgradable, GenesisProtocore, MosaicVersion, ValidatorSet {



    function registerGenesisLink()
        external
    {

    }

    function proposeLink(
        bytes32 _sourceVoteMessageHash,
        bytes32 _targetBlockHash,
        uint256 _targetBlockHeight,
        bytes32 _sourceKernelHash,
        bytes32 _sourceOriginObservation,
        uint256 _sourceDynasty,
        uint256 _sourceAccumulatedGas,
        bytes32 _sourceCommitteeLock
    )
        external
    {

    }

    function registerVote(
        bytes32 _voteMessageHash,
        bytes32 _r,
        bytes32 _s,
        uint8 _v
    )
        external
    {
}

```
